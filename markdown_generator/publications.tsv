2022-10-01	Exploiting variable correlation with masked modeling for anomaly detection in time series.	Under Review.	Online anomaly detection in time series is a challenging task, especially when the time-series are stochastic. We propose a novel approach to exploit the correlation between variables in time series data to improve the performance of anomaly detection.	Lymperopoulos, P., Li, Y., & Liu, L. (2022).
