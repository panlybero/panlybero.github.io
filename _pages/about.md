This is the personal website of [Panagiotis Lymperopoulos](https://github.com/panlybero/panlybero.github.io). I am a PhD Candidate at Tufts University in the [Department of Computer Science] (https://www.cs.tufts.edu/). I am a member of the [Tufts Machine Learning Group](https://www.cs.tufts.edu/research/ml/index.html) and my advisor is [Prof. Liping Liu] https://www.eecs.tufts.edu/~liulp/). Currently, I am pursuing research ideas in the intersection of machine learning and logical reasoning. In the past I have worked on [anomaly detection](), the application of machine learning to [biological data]() and [natural language processing]().
