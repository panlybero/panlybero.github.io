This is the personal website of [Panagiotis Lymperopoulos](panlybero.github.io). I am a PhD Candidate at Tufts University in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.tufts.edu/). I am a member of the [Tufts Machine Learning Group](https://www.cs.tufts.edu/research/ml/index.html) and my advisor is [Prof. Liping Liu](https://www.eecs.tufts.edu/~liulp/). My current research is focused on improving the optimization of deep models for neurosymbolic systems. I am also actively working on applications integrating deep and machine learning with logical reasoning and larger cognitive systems. In the past I have worked on [anomaly detection](panlybero.github.io/publications), the application of machine learning to [biological data](panlybero.github.io/publications) and [natural language processing](panlybero.github.io/publications).
